# Lofi-doro
Study/productivity app based on the popular time management technique "Pomodoro". The Pomodoro technique involves using a timer to breakdown work periods into shorter intervals, usually 25 minutes in length, with short breaks in-between. Coupled with the popular music genre "Lo-Fi". The end goal of the project is to produce a mobile app that'll marry these two together.
